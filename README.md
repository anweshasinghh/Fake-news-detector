# Fake News Detector with AI Hint

This project aims to develop a fake news detector that incorporates two main AI features:

1.  **AI-powered fact-checking**: Analyzes news content to flag potentially false claims.
2.  **Source credibility assessment**: Evaluates the trustworthiness of news sources.

## Project Structure

- `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python dependencies.
- `data/`: Directory to store datasets.
- `models/`: Directory to store trained AI models.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing, model training, and the application.
- `app.py`: The main Flask application file.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
